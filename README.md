# Random problems found on the net

#### Random problems I'm solving on my spare time. These problems can be solved in a number of languages so this repo will contain a bunch of languages depending on what language I'm currently working with or if it requires a specific one. I'll try my best to add in where I found the problems as well as describe them.
